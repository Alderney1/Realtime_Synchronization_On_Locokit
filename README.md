Realtime_Synchronization_On_Locokit
===================================

This project is about a synchronization project which aim to synchronize two locokit boards over a wire- less network and test the synchronization by controlling locokit motors. This include to produces a synchronization algorithm to work in a wireless environment and motor controlling. This feature is es- sential in sensor networks where the time is an important factor in the measurements e.g. position and velocity. In those cases a common clock is not a possibility, therefore this method is used to solve the problem, on an alternative way. We choose this project, because we think it is relevant according to our course in EMB4. In this project we tried to synchronize a locokit, therefore our challenge in this project were to learn about locokit and get locokitâ€™s wireless and motors to work properly. Another challenge was to understand, how wireless synchronization in sensor networks are working and to choose which one how fits best to our project. Here we used the basic of the RBS to make the synchronization. When the time is synchronized, a test setup is made to illustrate, how well the synchronization worked.
